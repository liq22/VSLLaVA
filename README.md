Welcome to **VSLLaVA**, a pioneering pipeline leveraging large multimodal foundation models for the analysis of industrial vibration signals. This repository hosts the codebase for our project, which combines advanced machine learning techniques with domain-specific knowledge to deliver state-of-the-art performance in industrial condition monitoring and fault diagnosis.

## Overview
**VSLLaVA** introduces an innovative approach to vibration signal analysis by integrating vision-language models and foundational AI methods, providing a new level of insight into the complex dynamics of industrial machinery. Our model is designed to enhance predictive maintenance, optimize operational efficiency, and reduce downtime in industrial environments.

For more details, you can view our research paper [here](https://arxiv.org/submit/5829808/view).

The code in this repository accompanies our research paper, which is currently under peer review. The repository will be fully accessible upon the acceptance of our paper.

## Status
**Current Stage:** Code is private. It will be made publicly available after the acceptance of the related research paper. Stay tuned for updates!
